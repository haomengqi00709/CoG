# Group Announcement

Hi everyone! 👋

I just completed an open-source project **CoG Research Intelligence** - a web application that uses AI to analyze research papers and connect them to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Want to share it with you all!

### 🎯 What It Does

- 📄 **PDF Analysis** - Upload research paper PDFs, AI automatically extracts key insights
- 🔍 **PMC Search** - Search PubMed Central for open-access papers by UN SDG
- 🎯 **SDG Mapping** - Automatically identifies primary and secondary Sustainable Development Goals
- 📝 **Plain-Language Summaries** - Converts complex research into accessible insights
- 💡 **Actionable Challenges** - Generates practical tasks based on research findings
- 📊 **Excel Export** - Batch export all analysis results to spreadsheet

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **AI:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Data Source:** NCBI PMC (PubMed Central)
